                <b>Movie Review – The Ritual (2017)</b><br />

                <i>14 October 2017 by Helen Murdoch Flickeringmyth</i><br />
                <br /><b>The Ritual, 2017.</b><br />

                Directed by David Bruckner.

                Starring Rafe Spall, Robert James-Collier, Arsher Ali, Sam Troughton and Paul Reid.

                Synopsis:

                A group of college friends reunite for a trip to the forest, but encounter a menacing presence in the woods that’s stalking them.

                After their friend is tragically killed during a robbery, 4 of his friends Luke (Spall), Hutch (James-Collier), Phil (Ali) and Dom (Troughton) embark on a hike in the Swedish wilderness to honour their friend. Along the way they encounter something strange in the woods that begins to hunt them.

                The Ritual is a typical British horror film and by that I mean that there are a ton of laughs to start with, characters who you genuinely empathise with and some legitimate scares. Our main character is Luke (Spall) who is dealing with his guilt over his friend’s demise, something that haunts him all the way through the film.
